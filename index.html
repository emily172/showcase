                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The objective of my final year project is to create a comprehensive design
                    to enhance the UX and UI for a tattoo studio located in Waterford called Inkpots in relation to its
                    online presence and client engagement.

                    Tattoos have a rich history, dating back thousands of years, serving as a form of personal
                    expression, cultural significance, and art using many different forms of techniques and methods for
                    inserting inks into a fixed place on the body.

                    Despite their popularity, many studios face the common issue of not having a proper online presence.
                    If they do, it’s often an outdated WordPress or Wix website that is broken, insecure, and not
                    visually pleasing or easy to navigate, or they rely on social media sites such as Facebook,
                    Instagram, or WhatsApp. This makes it difficult for clients to find reliable information about the
                    studio, view artists’ portfolios, and get in touch with the studio and their favourite tattoo
                    artist.

                    As a developer, I want to help a tattoo studio improve its online presence, much like a web
                    solutions company would, enabling them to move away from relying solely on outdated websites or
                    social media platforms. It targets towards studios operating on a budget, ensuring that
                    cost-effective advanced technologies solutions are included keeping up the studios work quality.
                    Thereby, This project involves creating a modern, centralized web application that enhances the
                    studio’s online presence and client engagement using the latest technologies.

                I have started to develop the tattoo studio web app. The homepage was created using React and
                React-Bootstrap, incorporating npm packages and React Icons for enhanced functionality and a responsive
                design. I initiated the real-time chat feature development using Socket.io and Node.js to enable a way
                for user communication. Additionally, I experimented with the Microsoft Image Generator to create custom
                images and tested various technologies for compatibility.
